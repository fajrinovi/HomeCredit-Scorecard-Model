# HomeCredit-Scorecard-Model

#### Project Background:
Financial institutions provide credit services to meet the needs of society, both consumptive and productive. Many people struggle to get a loan because of insufficient or non-existent credit history. Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data to predict their clients' repayment abilities to ensure their clients have a positive loan experience. So that will ensure that clients who are able to pay back are not turned down and loans are provided with a principal, maturity, and repayment schedule that will empower their clients to succeed.
